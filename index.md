## You Don’t Need a Map<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->


> A flashy map, in color with an unconventional projection, touts its author’s
sense of innovation, and cartographic window dressing in a doctoral
dissertation or academic journal suggests the work is scholarly or
scientific.

<span class="credit">[Monmonier, _How to Lie with Maps_](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo27400568.html), 157.</span>

Note: In the early 90s classic How to Lie With Maps, Marc Monmonier begins the
epilogue with a “cautionary noted about the increased likelihood of
cartographic distortion when a map must play the dual role of both informing
and impressing its audience.

Reading these lines when I was writing my own dissertation stung, because I
was planning on incorporating so many maps of my own. But as I’ve gotten
older, I’ve gotten more sympathetic to the view. Especially, since I think
Monmonier misses a third role. That is, the tension between informing and
impressing is further compounded by the desire for a map to be more than an
informer. A bit more abstractly:

<img style="width: 33%;" alt="Kircher and Lyon" src="https://i.imgur.com/FPeYP7L.png">

<span class="credit">Kircher, _Ars Magna Sciendi_ (1669) and Lyon, “Web
Traffic Visualization” in [Drucker,
_Graphesis_](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674724938), 2.</span>

Note: Johanna Drucker opens the book Graphesis with these two reproductions.
One is almost four hundred years old, and the other could be four minutes old.
I’ve just included them here to set up how Drucker describes them.

> At first these two images seem remarkably similar. Both appear to be
representations of knowledge networks made of points and lines. But one was
first published in 1669 by Athanasius Kircher as a demonstration of the system
of the medieval mystic Ramon Llull’s “great art of knowing.” The other was
created more than three hundred years later. Generative, diagrammatic,
dynamic, Kircher’s image produces the knowledge it draws. By contrast, the
recent image of Web traffic only displays information. It is representation of
knowledge, not a knowledge generator, whose graphic display conceals the
decisions and processes on which it was based. Kircher’s image was generative
and dynamic by contrast to the fixed representational image it resembles.<!--
.element: style="font-size: .6em;" -->

<span class="credit">Drucker, _Graphesis_, 3.</span>

Note: Drucker makes a vital distinction between the two images. The former is
a knowledge generator. It produces the knowledge it draws. The latter,
however, is merely a representation of knowledge. Fixed instead of dynamic. 

In one sense, It tells us nothing we don’t already know. That is, oh: the web
is chaotic yet enmeshed. We knew that already. More importantly, we cannot use
the representation to generate new knowledge. Furthermore, it obscures the
distortions that led to its generation. So while these two visualizations
might not be maps per se, the problem still applies.

## You Don’t Need a Map<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

### Maps Lie.

* Does my map generate knowledge?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Does my map allow the reader to ask new questions?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Do my scratch maps that I used to find new questions belong in my published work?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


Note: Maps lie. They must. No map can purport to be a perfect representation of the
area it represents. Typically, we’re ok with that. We don’t expect Google
Maps, for example, to include a mark for every first date we’ve been on, yet
we may associate places precisely with things like first dates. “That’s the
café where…” is a statement about the world, but it won’t be on any map.

## You Don’t Need a Map<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

### Maps Overassert


Note: On the other hand, maps also overassert. They're overdetermined in a way,
carrying epistemological, ideological, political, and other layers fused
together in an overrich cake. Worse, that overassertion can be read as "extra
truth." Google Maps said this was the way to get there!, as though there is
only one way of describing a route--or the destination itself.

---

> Did it start with Bergson, or before? Space was treated as the dead, the
fixed, the undialectical, the immobile. Time, on the contrary, was richness,
fecundity, life, dialectic.

<span class="credit">[Foucault, “Questions on Geography,”](https://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/73967) 70.</span>

Note: That overassertion has multiple valences. Michel Foucault wonders about
a “devaluation of space that has prevailed for generations.” But that fixed
nature of space also lets it transcend and suggests that it is a window to
universality. Fixing space is a means of exerting control or domination over
it.

<img alt="Massey pages 2 and 3" style="width: 65%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/CWRhcHJ.png">

<span class="credit">[_Codex Mendoza_](https://codicemendoza.inah.gob.mx/inicio.php) (c.1541) and Cortés, [_Mexico City_](https://www.newberry.org/file/hern-n-cort-s-mexico-city-1524-woodcut-vault-ayer-65551c8-1524d-0) (1524), in [Massey, _For Space_](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/for-space/book227109), 2–3.</span>

Note: Doreen Massey begins _For Space_ with a set of ruminations, of failures
of spatial imagination. "Failure in the sense of being inadequate to face up
to the challenges of space; a failure to take on board its coeval
multiplicities, to accept its radical contemporaneity, to deal with its
constitutive complexity. I like the juxtaposition Massey provides here,
between one “map” that tells a story embedded in time, and the other map that
serves only to inform and control.

But further, the juxtaposition also demonstrates how the idea of an abstract
mappable, that is to say, not-yet-mapped-but-soon, space where Cortés finds
the Aztecs as an obstacle instead of as a culture contributing to the
multiplicity and never-finishedness of space remains embedded in Western
thought about space 500 years later. And it’s very hard for that thought not
to inform our maps. Which is why, for me, the first question always is, “do I
actually need a map?”

---

## OK, You Do Need a Map<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

* Analysis (more than “inform”) 
* Presentation (perhaps less than “impress”)

Note: For me, I see the project of mapping as, broadly, two separate
endeavors, which can occur at once, but only with difficulty. 

I say here inform + and impress - to imagine these as part of Monmonier’s
dyad. 

---

## Analysis

* Researcher for themselves to generate knowledge
* Visualize distributions, measure correlations
* The realm of GIS (via [QGIS](https://qgis.org))

Note: Analysis I see as how the researcher or researchers generate knowledge
for themselves and their larger research project. When one uses mapping, they
are mapping in order to answer those questions and move their project forward. 

They may visualize spatial distributions, measure correlations, or perform
other geostatistical operations on the geospatial data they have collected

This kind of analysis is typically done with a GIS, a Geographical Information
System, which collects and maps layers of geospatial data.

---

## QGIS

<img alt="QGIS 2.8 screenshot" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/QGIS_2.8_screenshot.png" style="width: 80%;">

<span class="credit">[Wikimedia
Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:QGIS_2.8_screenshot.png)</span>

Note: No one will confuse QGIS with Google Maps. This is a screenshot of a
slightly older version, but the basic contours are the same. There are seven
distinct data layers included in this GIS, even though some, like the river
data layer, only have one item in them. By combining the data layers, the
analyst can do things like calculate the nearest school for every house, or
what the average journey time is along the main road.

---

## QGIS (and ArcGIS)

* Eric Glass leads periodic “Introduction to GIS” workshops
* Free and multi-platform
* Non-trivial learning curve
* Converting for print or websites is frustrating to impossible
* Scriptable with Python

---

## Presentation

* Researcher for others to generate knowledge
* Provide data for others to visualize
* The realm of, narrowly, webmapping (via [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com) or
  [Neatline](https://neatline.org/) for Omeka

Note: Presentation, in contrast, is how the researcher assembles their work to
allow it to generate knowledge for others.

Presentation can be simply a collection of data tables to dwonload with good,
descriptive metadata. Alternatively, in 2020 it often takes the shape of an
interactive web application, much like the election maps we have been clicking
on lately.

---

## Leaflet


<img alt="Leafletjs.com" src="https://i.imgur.com/m6JTOED.png" style="width: 50%;">

<span class="credit">[Leafletjs.com](http://leafletjs.com)</span>

Note: Leaflet is a JavaScript library, meaning maps are built and controlled
programmatically, typically inside a webpage. It uses the same slippy tile
metaphor that Google Maps does.

---

## Leaflet

* I lead periodic introductory Leaflet workshops
* Freely available JavaScript library
* Non-trivial learning curve
* Brilliant for creating interactive maps
* (Seemingly) Relies on Web Mercator Projection
* Many JavaScript frameworks tap into Leaflet’s API to make an even more
  ergonomic development experience (including Omeka’s
  [Mapping](https://omeka.org/s/docs/user-manual/modules/mapping/) module)

Note: You’ve probably used Leaflet as a user many times already. It’s a
popular alternative to Google Maps that lets developers avoid all of Google’s
traps and obstacles.

## But We’re Historians?<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

<img style="width: 60%;" alt="Vilna Lituaniae metropolis" src="https://i.imgur.com/klz6lLe.jpg">

Note: As with the Mendoza Codex and with just about any map created outside
the Western world or even any Western map created before the last few
centuries, maps for historians scoff at the technophilic drive to make
everything look like or fit on a Google map. Instead, historians often have to
deal with maps like this.

This is a 1576 map of Vilnius, the current capital of Lithuania. Monmonier
talks about having a Scandinavian map in your home because you're proud of
your Scandinavian heritage. My mom's family is from Lithuania, so I figured
I'd do something similar here. As a side note, I finished my dissertation
while living in an attic in this building.

## Make the Web Bend to You

1. Get and download a map you like (or [use the Vilnius map](https://i.imgur.com/klz6lLe.jpg))
2. Make a short list of points of interest (or copy these: `Das hoche Slochs,
   Das Slochs, S. Iohan kirche, Das Rhathaus, Die Deutsche gaße`)
3. Go to
   [`http://antirubbersheeter.moacir.com`](http://antirubbersheeter.moacir.com)
